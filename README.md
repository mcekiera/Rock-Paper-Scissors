# Rock-Paper-Scissors

Simple game, my first JavaScript project. Its sole purpose, is to learn basics of JS, and its interactions with HTML and CSS,
without use of libraries, like jQuery.

It contains two version of this trivial game:
- classical - <i>Rock-paper-scissors,</i>
- modern - <i>Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock.</i>
